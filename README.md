How to host your own AGAC API instance

### 🐬 Docker Method (recommended)
1. Pull the image
```sh
docker pull r3tr0ananas/agac-api:latest
``` 
2. Then launch a container with this command.
> *you don't really need to mount a volume but it's recommended*
```sh
docker run -p 8000:8000/tcp -v ./cached_images:/app/assets/cache r3tr0ananas/agac-api:latest
```
3. Now visit ``localhost:8000`` in your browser and there you go!
> *if you wanna use docker-compose, [this file](./docker-compose.yml) might be useful to you*
